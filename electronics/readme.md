Acquire R/C toys (cars), each with different frequency (27MHz/49MHz).

We need to have 4 motors, and a way to control each ones direction. Two RC cars will usually result in 4 motors, and 8 buttons (2 for each motor to control direction)

Note: most encodr/decoder chips on a cheap R/C toy are based on the 5 function TX2C & RX2C chips
